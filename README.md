# Time-varying effects of the shale boom.

In this repository, I explore the time-varying effects of the shale boom on communities in the U.S. My interest in this general topic is twofold: (1) I suspect that the economic effects of the shale boom - whether focused on labor, housing markets, etc., - have changed over time; and (2) I am the sort that requires an application to dive into the nuts-and-bolts of a new series of methods. 

For the latter point, I am interested in learning about the methods discussed in the flood of research on difference-in-differences variants with time-varying treatment. I'm particularly interested in the decomposition method of Goodman-Bacon (2021). The shale boom did not occur in all communities in the U.S. at a single time period. Instead, the treatment was staggered from 2005-2012 across the states. 

At this point, my interest is more on learning the method than the applied work.
